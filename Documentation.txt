Classes and Objects:
Classes (Task, PriorityTask, TaskList) are defined, representing different entities in the task management system.
Objects are created (task_list, new_task, new_priority_task) to represent instances of these classes.

Constructor:
__init__ methods are implemented in each class to initialize the attributes when an object is created.

Method Overriding:
mark_complete method in PriorityTask overrides the same method in the parent class Task.
to_s method in PriorityTask overrides the same method in the parent class Task.

Inheritance:
PriorityTask class inherits from the Task class, inheriting its attributes and methods.

Encapsulation:
Attributes of each class are encapsulated within the class, and access is controlled through methods.

Polymorphism:
to_s method is polymorphic, providing different implementations in Task and PriorityTask.

These concepts together contribute to a well-structured, object-oriented design for the Task List Application
